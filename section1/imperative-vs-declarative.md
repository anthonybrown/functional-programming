# A comparison of imperative vs declarative programming.

- Imperative programming
  - Example: OOP
  - Focus on HOW
  - Stateful
  - We can mutate state
  - Often rely on side-effects

- Declarative programming
  - Example: Functional
  - Focus on WHAT
  - Stateless
  - Constants, immutability
  - No Side-Effects
